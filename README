Bones, the simple HTML mockup framework.

What it does:

  - Provides a simple framework for creating views
    without worrying about controllers
  - Allows the building of a complete static website
    out of views, partials, and layouts which can
    then be combined into full HTML pages for deployment
    onto ANY webserver.

Requirements:

  - ActiveSupport
  - rack (0.3.0 only at this time)

Starting it up:

	- Install

	  sudo gem install scharfie-bones -s http://gems.github.com

	- Generate:

	  bones my_bones_app
	  cd my_bones_app

  - Serve

    rake server
 
  - Browse:

    http://localhost:3000
  
Flatten your views into .html files:

	- Cache
    rake cache            # without versioning
    rake cache:versioned  # with versioning

Then upload the entire public/ directory to your server.

Advanced features:

  - Use a base URL path when caching
    (for example, you need to deploy to example.com/mybonesapp)

    rake cache BASE=/mybonesapp

  - Use custom cache directory

    rake cache DESTINATION=/some/other/path

  - Dry-run (noop) for testing settings without creating any files

    rake cache NOOP=true
